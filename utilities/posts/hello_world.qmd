- First article idea StationDC advice:
    - Be as human as possible in your correspondence, especially in cold emails. Remember your audience, but be yourself.
    - Cold emails work if you’re trying to talk to someone very senior. Someone really likes your Chutzpah and resume, and got invited to more events.
    - The first cold email was sent via the DoD’s email network ARPA-Net, and it resulted in $30M in sales.
    - The Nigerian Prince works for a reason.
    - More people are looking for more human connection, not less. The more colloquial Christon makes his emails, the more people respond- not less.
