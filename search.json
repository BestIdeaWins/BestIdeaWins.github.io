    "section": "What Founders Think Pitching Is",
    "text": "What Founders Think Pitching Is\nMost early-stage technical founders—particularly those coming out of academic environments—approach pitching like a poster presentation.\nThe instinct is straightforward: lay out the problem, describe the solution, and walk through the underlying research—often in unintentionally excruciating detail.\nThe presumption being that with enough context, the right conclusion should follow and the value will be obvious.\nThe instinct isn’t careless. It’s an engrained belief trained over decades and perpetuated by mentors, peers, and expectant subordinates: .\nCredibility is earned by demonstrating rigor and command of detail. Posters, papers, grant applications, dissertation defenses—these are formats where explaining the science is the work.\nPrecision is rewarded. Completeness signals seriousness. The ability to defend assumptions is the measure of competence.\nSo, when these founders pitch, they do what humans do best: fall back on the trained behaviors they know work.\nIf pitching was a question of science we wouldn’t need investors- we’d have more grant panels.\nFounders often assume the audience is engaging like a reviewer or examiner—that the primary task in the room is comprehension.\nBut pitch audiences, and the investors that compose them, are not trying to understand because investors are not in the business of understanding. Investors are in the business of deciding:\nWhether to keep listening or engage further. Whether to allocate scarce time, attention, credibility, or capital to the opportunity presented to them right now.\nAs a lifelong cinephile, allow me to put this in familiar terms,\n\nA pitch is more akin to a movie trailer: it’s selective and compressed; a few scenes, a sense of stakes, and a reason to keep watching.\nWhat I see technical founders actually make is a director’s commentary: a long-form explanation to an already invested audience that wants to understand how the movie came to be.\n\nMost pitch rooms are made for movie trailers, even if founders show up with their commentary track.\nUntil that misalignment is addressed, no amount of refinement helps:\n\nYou can explain better and still stall.\nYou can add slides and still lose momentum.\nYou can articulate extraordinary science and still fail to trigger a decision.\n\nTo understand why, we first have to be clear."

    "text": "And a pitch is NOT a grant application.\nGrant logic is about justification.\nIt’s a case for continued research that is often evaluated by people who are trained to reward technical merit and methodological thoroughness.\nPitch logic is similar, but the audience is very different. Investors are not deciding whether your work is worthy of continued research. They’re deciding whether it’s worth it to them; their time, their attention, their credibility, their capital—right now, and relative to everything else— they could support instead.\nThe science never fails in these scenarios. The pitch does.\nFounders bring the instincts that earned them success in one arena into a room governed by an entirely different set of rules.\nIt’s like dropping a pole vaulter into a hockey game—they could be world-class, but they didn’t train to take a hit from a six-foot-five enforcer who’s built like a refrigerator.\nIn pitch rooms, there’s no deafening air horn and no flashing scoreboard. The loss is quieter because it manifests as polite disengagement. That’s why the feedback often sounds encouraging, even when it’s a clear no:\n\n“This is really interesting work.”\n“You clearly know the space well.”\n“I’m not sure it fits our focus right now, but it’s thoughtful work.”\n\nA pitch is not a poster, paper, or grant application.\nSo, what is it?"

If academia is the classical physics of the proven, capital is the dark matter of the possible—synthesizing empirical data with the unquantifiable gravity of markets.\nThat is to say, investors aren’t just assessing your work’s empiricism, they’re also assessing you.\nWhen founders talk about tradeoffs; when they demonstrate their priorities when time runs short; when they can acknowledge uncertainty without losing their footing; whether their answers suggest they’ve navigated difficulties before, or if this is the first real test.\nInvestors hunt for these signals- any information which gives investors an edge is information they’ll leverage: in what founders emphasize, what they skip, in how they handle questions when the conversation veers off script. It’s all fair game.\nThis is not because the audience is ignoring the idea. It’s because the idea is solid and, for an investor to conduct their due diligence, they have to test everything else- especially you."

    "text": "From Activity to Judgment\nUniversities love pipelines because pipelines feel fair — and because they come with a comforting logic: put enough things in, keep them moving, and something good is bound to come out the other end. It sounds rational. It sounds efficient.\n\nIt sounds like progress. It isn’t.\n\nCommercialization is not a conveyor belt. It’s not forward motion by default. It’s a series of uncomfortable, explicit decisions made under uncertainty. It requires someone — or some system — to look at the evidence and say: this moves forward. This doesn’t. This goes here. This stops.\nCommercialization is a set of gated decisions under uncertainty:\n\nIs this worth advancing?\nWhich pathway makes sense right now — license, startup, strategic partnership, or stop?\nWhat is the next value inflection point?\nWho has to believe what, by when, for this to work?\nAnd who, specifically, is going to pay for it?\n\nA serious commercialization system is designed to answer those questions repeatedly, quickly, and with evidence.\nAnd this is where some university innovation activity tends to miss the mark.\nIt’s easier to schedule the next workshop than it is to force a meaningful decision. It’s safer to move a project into the next cohort than to decide whether it should exist at all. Activity feels productive, it generates updates, it fills dashboards, and it fools everyone into feeling engaged.\nWhen a university treats programming and activity as an outcomes, everything becomes a KPI. Everything counts as progress. The pitch night counts. The fireside chat counts. The networking cocktail hour counts.\nAnd because all of these count, no one bothers to ask the harder questions:\n\nWhat risk was reduced?\nWhat belief was validated?\nWhat capital was committed?\nWhat changed?\n\nIf the answer is nothing changed except the calendar, then you’ve planned a wedding without vows — beautifully staged, masterfully orchestrated, and fundamentally empty."

    "text": "Progress Over Production Value\nThere are commercialization/innovation systems that tilt toward decisions and outcomes — rather than optics and attendance.\nFor example, there are dedicated proof-of-concept funding models that lean on staged, evidence-based gates. Programs, such as the NIH Proof-of-Concept Centers1, require projects to tie funding to defined technical and commercial milestones — actual prototypes, feasibility data, and market engagement — before advancement is allowed.\n\nSupport isn’t awarded because a workshop was full; it’s awarded because real evidence of commercial potential exists AND risk has been meaningfully reduced. This kind of gate-driven progression tends to produce more actual licensing outcomes, not just piles of post-event clickbait.\nThat’s what gating looks like. That’s decision infrastructure."

    "text": "Decisions, Decisions, Decisions,\nTechnology Transfer, Technology Development, and Technology Commercialization Offices (TTOs/OTD/OTCs) inside universities are supposed to serve the same role — not as programming machines but as decision makers.\nA 2024 study exploring the current state of technology transfer in the U.S.2 finds that offices that emphasize structured engagement and market connection strategies tend to be more effective in bridging research and markets than those that don’t. For example, of those high preforming offices:\n\n~35% use customized licensing agreements tailored to specific industry needs,\n~30% have collaborative research ventures to align academic output with commercial partners’ most pressing issue,\nand ~20% have industry-sponsored research programs that embed external incentives early,\n\nSome offices have even redesigned the licensing gate itself1. A handful of TTOs, like the University of Cincinnati3 and the University of Missouri System4, have developed express licensing mechanisms — standardized, take-it-or-leave-it agreements with predefined terms — to cut out negotiation drag and get technologies into industry hands faster. These aren’t fancy events with cranberry baked brie bites — they’re structural interventions designed to force a decision about whether a technology will move forward or not, without weeks of back-and-forth over terms.\n\n\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati\n\n\nThe Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM) 2024 Licensing Activity Survey5 demonstrates real commercialization outcomes tell the most meaningful story. Research institutions continued to navigate funding shifts and strategic uncertainty while producing measurable market outcomes.\nU.S. research expenditures reached roughly $109 billion, underlining the scale of raw innovation output. Invention disclosures continued to climb; and institutions reported steady startup formation and new products entering the market during the reporting period. Universities reported:\n\n26,196 invention disclosures\n14,432 new U.S. patent applications filed\n\n— the idea machine is humming. But that’s only half the story. The real signal shows up here:\n\n9,507 licenses and options executed,\n775 new products created, and\n951 startups formed.\n\nThat’s the difference between programming and productivity. One fills seats. The other produces outcomes.\nWhen a TTO builds structured decision points — milestones that reduce technical risk, demonstrate market interest, and negotiate commitment — it makes progress. The AUTM survey5 shows that offices leaning into those practices continue generating startups, licenses, and other real, quantifiable outcomes."

    "text": "Each year, research universities across the U.S. generate more than 1,000 startup companies armed with cutting-edge technology to outcompete a fast-moving market. Normally, the complexity of negotiations required to finalize the IP licensing wouldn’t be that far removed from a Wall-street M&A deal- so how did UVA and Virginia Tech shorten their IP licensing process from university-standard timelines (~9–12 months) to ~30–60 days?\nIn my role as Program Manager for Georgetown Tech Ventures within Georgetown’s Office of Technology Commercialization (OTC), I’ve seen multiple successful startups to market, and regardless whether they’re founded by faculty, PhD candidates, or even graduate students, the highest-performing teams approached licensing as an opportunity for strategic alignment rather than a bureaucratic hurdle to rush through.\nI’ve seen countless times how the most consistent inflection point in a startup’s journey is the initial licensing of university technology—the moment when IP ownership, growth milestones, and estimated royalty payments converge. It’s only when all those contentious pieces align, a startup can finally raise capital, recruit a team, and set course for market impact.\nThat’s why we’re excited about Express Licensing; a more resource-efficient, strategically relevant, and robust IP licensing framework for getting cutting-edge research to market, faster."

    "text": "Licensing and Startup Activity in Numbers\nExpress Licensing frameworks are maturing in the midst of robust tech-transfer activity, signaling both demand and opportunity for founders and investors alike:\n\nNational data shows U.S. universities issued ~8,800 new licenses for research-generated IP in 2021, and the share going to startups and small firms grew from 69% to 78% over a decade. Between 2015 and 2021, more than 1,000 startups licensed and commercialized academic technology each year.\nMeanwhile, the AUTM’s (Association of University Technology Managers) 2024 Licensing Activity Survey shows that technology transfer offices continue to manage “high volumes of disclosures, licensing activity, and startup formation even as funding dynamics and staffing pressures evolve.”\n\nIt’s in this high-volume context that Express Licensing offers an additional efficiency-boost: it gives licensing offices the slack to meet new, potential-licensees without sacrificing their time with their existing startup portfolio. While it is a significant investment to stand-up an Express License program, the most successful universities have been reaping dividends year-over-year:\n\nAt The University of Georgia (UGA), the Innovation Gateway runs the Georgia Startup License, a structured program that combines market-readiness assessments with Express Licensing agreements. UGA staff and mentors help founders execute a gap analysis and action plan, place founders in programming such as I-Corps, and after satisfying predefined requirements, startups unlock an Express License with increasingly favorable terms, including discounted incubator space and priority support services.\nAt the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Technology Licensing Office (TLO) offers Expedited Licenses, especially for software and other standardized intellectual property categories. Interested parties agree to MIT’s pre-set terms and simply return a signed agreement, which greatly reduces back-and-forth negotiation and maintains robust transparency and clear expectations.\n\nExpress Licensing frameworks give startups confidence in their IP licensing early in the process, and that confidence is vital: it allows founders to fundraise, develop new business, and surpass their operational milestones without spending the egregious amount of time it traditionally takes on licensing-contract negotiation.\nExpress Licensing and Standard Terms work because they give startups, investors, and institutions the confidence to partner before they even meet."
