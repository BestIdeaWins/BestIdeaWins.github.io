<section id="one-fine-day" class="level1">
<h1>One Fine Day,</h1>
<p>In <em>The Wedding Planner</em>, Jennifer Lopez plays a woman who has built an entire career orchestrating other people’s weddings. Seating charts are flawless. Timelines are immaculate. The lighting hits just right for those pre-social media photos. She manages emotion, optics, and choreography with military precision.</p>
<p>For those who haven’t seen it: she plans everyone else’s big day because she quietly believes she’s not going to have one of her own, stating, “Those who can’t wed, plan.” So, she perfects the ceremony instead. And then, as was often the case in early 2000’s rom-coms, Matthew McConaughey shows up, complications ensue, and — all the while — the movie reminds us of something simple: planning a wedding is not the same thing as building a marriage.</p>
<p>If you squint, a lot of university “innovation ecosystems” look eerily similar.</p>
<p>You have mastered the ceremony. Pitch nights sell out. Demo days are standing room only. Calendars are packed. LinkedIn is thriving. The choreography is precise, the optics are polished, the programming tight. But months later, you look up and realize nothing meaningful has been committed — no capital, no customers, no real company.</p>
<p>Beautiful ceremony. No marriage.</p>
<p>“Those who can’t wed, plan.” In some corners of university commercialization, it feels more like those who can’t commercialize, program.</p>
</section>
<section id="busy-is-not-productive" class="level1">
<h1>Busy Is Not Productive</h1>
<p>This failure has almost nothing to do with talent or idea quality, and nearly everything to do with a system designed to generate motion without a reliable mechanism for carrying work from one decision point to another.</p>
<p>Universities are extremely good at producing activity. Applications are counted. Mentors are logged. Cohorts are launched. Attendance stays up. Engagement stays high. The photos look great.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We are LinkedIn royalty!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But underneath that flurry of activity, the technologies sit in roughly the same place they were before — neither meaningfully advanced nor decisively stopped. They just are. They’re present. On the slide. In the portfolio. Stuck between gates.</p>
<p>This is like getting a flat tire and convening a panel of experts in rubber compounds, axle alignment, optimal PSI, and lug-nut metallurgy — listening to their insights on best practices for tire performance within the broader automotive ecosystem — instead of just changing the tire.</p>
<section id="from-activity-to-judgment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-activity-to-judgment">From Activity to Judgment</h2>
<p>Universities love pipelines because pipelines feel fair — and because they come with a comforting logic: put enough things in, keep them moving, and something good is bound to come out the other end. It sounds rational. It sounds efficient. It sounds like progress.</p>
<p>It isn’t.</p>
<p>Commercialization is not a conveyor belt. It’s not forward motion by default. It’s a series of uncomfortable, explicit decisions made under uncertainty. It requires someone — or some system — to look at the evidence and say: this moves forward. This doesn’t. This goes here. This stops.</p>
<p>Commercialization is a set of gated decisions under uncertainty:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this worth advancing?</li>
<li>Which pathway makes sense right now — license, startup, strategic partnership, or stop?</li>
<li>What is the next value inflection point?</li>
<li>Who has to believe what, by when, for this to work?</li>
<li>And who, specifically, is going to pay for it?</li>
</ul>
<p>A serious commercialization system is designed to answer those questions repeatedly, quickly, and with evidence.</p>
<p>And this is where some university innovation activity tends to miss the mark.</p>
<p>It’s easier to schedule the next workshop than it is to force a meaningful decision. It’s safer to move a project into the next cohort than to decide whether it should exist at all. Activity feels productive, it generates updates, it fills dashboards, and it fools everyone into feeling engaged.</p>
<p>When a university treats programming and activity as an outcomes, everything becomes a KPI. Everything counts as progress. The pitch night counts. The fireside chat counts. The networking cocktail hour counts.</p>
<p>And because all of these count, no one bothers to ask the harder questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What risk was reduced?</li>
<li>What belief was validated?</li>
<li>What capital was committed?</li>
<li>What changed?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the answer is nothing changed except the calendar, then you’ve planned a wedding without vows — beautifully staged, masterfully orchestrated, and fundamentally empty.</p>
</section>
<section id="progress-over-production-value" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="progress-over-production-value">Progress Over Production Value</h2>
<p>There are commercialization/innovation systems that tilt toward decisions and outcomes — rather than optics and attendance.</p>
<p>For example, there are dedicated proof-of-concept funding models that lean on staged, evidence-based gates. Programs, such as the NIH Proof-of-Concept Centers<span class="citation" data-cites="bailey2025paths"><sup>1</sup></span>, require projects to tie funding to defined technical and commercial milestones — actual prototypes, feasibility data, and market engagement — before advancement is allowed.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583912372325-0c5be28e3590?q=80&amp;w=1474&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Support isn’t awarded because a workshop was full; it’s awarded because real evidence of commercial potential exists AND risk has been meaningfully reduced. This kind of gate-driven progression tends to produce more actual licensing outcomes, not just piles of post-event clickbait.</p>
<p>That’s what gating looks like. That’s decision infrastructure.</p>
</section>
<section id="decisions-decisions-decisions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="decisions-decisions-decisions">Decisions, Decisions, Decisions,</h2>
<p>Technology Transfer, Technology Development, and Technology Commercialization Offices (TTOs/OTD/OTCs) inside universities are supposed to serve the same role — not as programming machines but as decision makers.</p>
<p>A 2024 study exploring the current state of technology transfer in the U.S.<span class="citation" data-cites="eidlisz2024exploring"><sup>2</sup></span> finds that offices that emphasize structured engagement and market connection strategies like:</p>
<ul>
<li>customized licensing agreements tailored to specific industry needs (used by about 35 % of offices),</li>
<li>collaborative research ventures that align academic output with commercial partners (about 30 %),</li>
<li>and industry-sponsored research programs that embed external incentives early (about 20 %),</li>
</ul>
<p>— tend to be more effective in bridging research and markets than those that don’t.</p>
<p>Some offices have even redesigned the licensing gate itself. A handful of TTOs, like the University of Cincinnati<span class="citation" data-cites="uc2023exploring"><sup>3</sup></span> and the University of Missouri System<span class="citation" data-cites="umissouriexpress"><sup>4</sup></span>, have developed express licensing mechanisms — standardized, take-it-or-leave-it agreements with predefined terms — to cut out negotiation drag and get technologies into industry hands faster. These aren’t fancy events with cranberry baked brie bites — they’re structural interventions designed to force a decision about whether a technology will move forward or not, without weeks of back-and-forth over terms.</p>

<p>The Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM) 2024 Licensing Activity Survey<span class="citation" data-cites="autm2024licensing"><sup>5</sup></span> demonstrates real commercialization outcomes tell the most meaningful story. Research institutions continued to navigate funding shifts and strategic uncertainty while producing measurable market outcomes.</p>
<p>U.S. research expenditures reached roughly $109 billion, underlining the scale of raw innovation output. Invention disclosures continued to climb; and institutions reported steady startup formation and new products entering the market during the reporting period. Universities reported:</p>
<ul>
<li>26,196 invention disclosures</li>
<li>14,432 new U.S. patent applications filed</li>
</ul>
<p>— the idea machine is humming. But that’s only half the story. The real signal shows up here:</p>
<ul>
<li>9,507 licenses and options executed,</li>
<li>775 new products created, and</li>
<li>951 startups formed.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the difference between programming and productivity. One fills seats. The other produces outcomes.</p>
<p>When a TTO builds structured decision points — milestones that reduce technical risk, demonstrate market interest, and negotiate commitment — it makes progress. The AUTM survey<span class="citation" data-cites="autm2024licensing"><sup>5</sup></span> shows that offices leaning into those practices continue generating startups, licenses, and other real, quantifiable outcomes.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="the-pitch-day-trap" class="level1">
<h1>The Pitch Day Trap</h1>
<p>If your commercialization system treats packed pitch rooms and demo nights as the success metric, you’ve lost the plot.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556761175-5973dc0f32e7?q=80&amp;w=1932&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In many TTO/OTC-linked commercialization ecosystems, pitch competitions and showcase events become the de-facto milestones — the things you build calendars around, measure “engagement” on, and post about afterward. But if you treat that as progress, if you treat stage presence and applause as alignment, you’re optimizing for performance, not outcomes.</p>
<p>An effective pitch shouldn’t be just a god performance. Pitching is supposed to come after the hard questions about what comes next and why have been answered:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the next commercialization decision, and what evidence clears it?</li>
<li>What proof of market interest have you gathered?</li>
<li>What experiments remain, and how quickly can you run them?</li>
<li>What is your stopping rule — the point at which you decide to pivot or halt?</li>
<li>What commitment are you asking for, specifically, and why now?</li>
</ul>
<p>A field study of pitch training — where would-be founders were randomly assigned to receive training or not and then tracked over time — found that training does indeed improve pitch delivery and increases participation in future competitions and related programming<span class="citation" data-cites="assenova2024poised"><sup>6</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Participants worked on their pitches longer and appeared in more events and accelerators afterward. But those gains in presentation quality and participation did not reliably translate into stronger, long-term outcomes like hiring employees or sustaining ventures; in fact, those who received pitch training were sometimes more likely to abandon their initial ventures.</p>
<p>In plain English: better slides and a confident stage presence will get a presenter into more demo nights and more pitch rooms. They do not automatically make your venture more investable, more viable, or more likely to survive in the marketplace.</p>
<p>When commercialization systems reward strong stage presence over timely decision-making, they end up optimizing for packed pitch rooms, high attendance counts, and social media engagement instead of optimizing for what really matters: licenses executed, capital committed, partnerships formed, market captured, and ventures launched.</p>
<p>If your KPI is how many teams stood on stage and burped their way through a slide deck at whatever Showcase last fall, you’ll get pitches. You’ll get a lot of them. But, if your KPI is how many of those teams executed a license or secured a defined and material commitment within six months, you’ll build a very different system — a system built around decisions and outcomes, not optics</p>
<p>Better ceremony. Same marriage rate.</p>
</section>
<section id="time-is-the-kpi" class="level1">
<h1>Time Is <strong>The</strong> KPI</h1>
<p>If you want to know whether a commercialization system is real, don’t look at the calendar. Look at the clock.</p>
<ul>
<li>How long from disclosure to a provisional filing?</li>
<li>How long from MTA or option agreement discussion to execution?</li>
<li>How long from CDA/NDA to a term sheet?</li>
</ul>
<p>Time is a truth serum. It exposes what dashboards politely ignore.</p>
<p>Because delays are rarely mysterious. They usually mean one of three things: no one owns the decision, no one wants to make the call, or the system is far better at generating meetings than it is at producing outcomes.</p>
<p>Every extra month between interest and action increases the odds that an investor reallocates capital, a corporate partner shifts priorities, or a founder decides to build somewhere else. Not because they’re impatient — because the market is impatient. Because they have options.</p>
<p>This is the part institutions don’t like to say out loud: if your system tolerates slow decisions, it’s not aligned with markets. It’s aligned with itself.</p>
<p>Time-to-decision isn’t an internal bureaucratic KPI. It’s a market-alignment metric. It tells you whether your system can convert curiosity into commitment — innovation into impact — before the opportunity expires.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-ecosystem-doesnt-wait" class="level1">
<h1>The Ecosystem Doesn’t Wait</h1>
<p>If a university can’t move technology from the lab into the real economy — if it can’t force decisions, clarify pathways, or reduce risk in ways that matter — the ecosystem does not slow down out of courtesy.</p>
<p>It adapts.</p>
<p>Sometimes it routes around you entirely. Founders form companies elsewhere. Industry partners engage directly with labs. Investors source deal flow through informal networks that bypass the official programming.</p>
<p>Other times it flows straight through you with almost no effect — like a hiccup in a hurricane. The meetings happen. The showcase gets hosted. Attendance numbers stay strong. The LinkedIn posts perform. The calendar fills. Everyone feels busy.</p>
<p>And nothing changes.</p>
<p>This is where institutional self-deception creeps in. Because the signals you’re tracking — applications, engagement, event turnout — all point upward. It feels like momentum. But when you look at the metrics that matter — capital committed, durable partnerships formed, technologies licensed, companies surviving beyond year one — the line is flat.</p>
<p>The ecosystem didn’t reject you. It just didn’t need you.</p>
<p>And when that happens consistently, you don’t become a catalyst. You become a waypoint — a well-lit and highly visible stop along the way to somewhere else.</p>
<p>You become indispensable to the ceremony, admired for the coordination, absent from the commitment.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-bottom-line" class="level1">
<h1>The Bottom Line</h1>
<p>Much like a marriage, only after the ceremony ends, can commitment really begin. A startup begins when capital is committed, customers are captured, and revenue is generated.</p>
<p>Until then, it’s just rehearsal, theater at best.</p>
<p>Universities do not lack talent. Or energy. Or ambition. What they lack is a model built for commitment. The current architecture excels at producing programming — panels, pitch nights, demo days, accelerators — because those outputs are visible, repeatable, and institutionally safe.</p>
<p>But commercialization is not choreography:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is capital allocation.</li>
<li>It is customer acquisition.</li>
<li>It is execution under constraint.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want companies instead of calendars, the system must reward progression over participation and move technologies, inventors, and teams toward real decision points — fund or don’t, build or stop, move forward or go the way of the dodo.</p>
<p>Otherwise, folks in such systems will continue mistaking activity for productivity and events for outcomes.</p>
<p>And we, dear reader, will remain an act one J-Lo in The Wedding Planner — perfecting the seating chart while waiting for Matthew McConaughey to stroll in with his Texan twang, sweep us off our feet, and make it all real.</p>

<h1>Part I: Why You’re Pitching Wrong</h1>
<section id="foreword" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="foreword">Foreword</h2>
<p>This series examines why early-stage technical founders with strong ideas and credible science often struggle to advance their pitches. Each piece isolates a different repeated pattern of mistakes across university spinouts and science-driven startups.</p>
<p>By the end, we’ll have articulated an investor’s mindset when they evaluate a technical pitch- making the entire thought-process legible so founders can know the rules of the inscrutable game investors are playing.</p>
<p>At Georgetown Tech Ventures, I work with early-stage academic startups and university spinouts every day—that means watching, reviewing, and refining pitches from faculty, graduate students, first-time founders, and newly formed teams. I watch them try, win or lose, to transmute research into companies.</p>
<p>It also means sitting on evaluation panels, judging pitch competitions, and seeing how different audiences can react differently to the same pitch.. It’s my job to sit, listen, question, and observe- the founders, the context, the science, and the outcomes. After a while, the patterns of behaviors that separate wins from losses have become undeniable:</p>
<p>Smart people. Serious work. Strong science. And yet, the pitch misses—not because the idea is bad, but because the pitch answers a different question than the one the audience is asking.</p>
<p>Earlier in my career, I was on the other side of the table; I ran a company and pitched to investors. Those accumulated experiences crystallized an idea: what compels founders often does not compel investors to commit time, resources, credibility, or capital.</p>
<p>This series is written from the accumulation of those experiences then and now. This isn’t pitch coaching, presentation advice, or a checklist for founders to “become better storytellers.”</p>
<p>This series explains how early-stage pitches are actually evaluated—and why so many well-intentioned founders, especially technical ones, systematically miss the decision they’re trying to influence.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="its-not-that-kind-of-meeting" class="level1">
<h1>It’s Not That Kind of Meeting</h1>
<section id="what-founders-think-pitching-is" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-founders-think-pitching-is">What Founders Think Pitching Is</h2>
<p>Most early-stage technical founders—particularly those coming out of academic environments—approach pitching like a poster presentation.</p>
<p>The instinct is straightforward: lay out the problem, describe the solution, and walk through the underlying research—often in unintentionally excruciating detail.</p>
<p>The presumption being that with enough context, the right conclusion should follow and the value will be obvious.</p>
<p>The instinct isn’t careless. It’s an engrained belief trained over decades and perpetuated by mentors, peers, and expectant subordinates: .</p>
<p>Credibility is earned by demonstrating rigor and command of detail. Posters, papers, grant applications, dissertation defenses—these are formats where explaining the science is the work.</p>
<p>Precision is rewarded. Completeness signals seriousness. The ability to defend assumptions is the measure of competence.</p>
<p>So, when these founders pitch, they do what humans do best: fall back on the trained behaviors they know work.</p>
<p>If pitching was a question of science we wouldn’t need investors- we’d have more grant panels.</p>
<p>Founders often assume the audience is engaging like a reviewer or examiner—that the primary task in the room is comprehension.</p>
<p>But pitch audiences, and the investors that compose them, are not trying to understand because investors are not in the business of understanding. Investors are in the business of deciding:</p>
<p>Whether to keep listening or engage further. Whether to allocate scarce time, attention, credibility, or capital to the opportunity presented to them right now.</p>
<p>As a lifelong cinephile, allow me to put this in familiar terms,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A pitch is more akin to a movie trailer: it’s selective and compressed; a few scenes, a sense of stakes, and a reason to keep watching.</p></li>
<li><p>What I see technical founders actually make is a director’s commentary: a long-form explanation to an already invested audience that wants to understand how the movie came to be.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Most pitch rooms are made for movie trailers, even if founders show up with their commentary track.</p>
<p>Until that misalignment is addressed, no amount of refinement helps:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can explain better and still stall.</li>
<li>You can add slides and still lose momentum.</li>
<li>You can articulate extraordinary science and still fail to trigger a decision.</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand why, we first have to be clear.</p>

<h1>What a Pitch Is Not</h1>
<section id="a-pitch-is-not-a-poster-presentation." class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-pitch-is-not-a-poster-presentation.">A pitch is NOT a poster presentation.</h2>
<p>A poster is designed for depth. It rewards completeness. It invites detours.</p>
<p>For example, if someone wants to zoom in on a methodological choice, a control condition, or an edge case, that’s a feature—not a flaw.</p>
<p>The discussion can meander in the manner as the path of discovery; never linear, never expected, and it’s a richer discussion for it.</p>
<p>A pitch isn’t built for that.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-pitch-is-not-a-white-paper." class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-pitch-is-not-a-white-paper.">A pitch is NOT a white paper.</h2>
<p>White papers assume time.</p>
<p>They assume rereading. They assume the reader can pause, backtrack, annotate, and come back later. They are meant to be referenced and absorbed. They can carry nuance because the format allows for it.</p>
<p>A pitch doesn’t allow for that kind of attention.</p>
</section>
<section id="and-a-pitch-is-not-a-grant-application." class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="and-a-pitch-is-not-a-grant-application.">And a pitch is NOT a grant application.</h2>
<p>Grant logic is about justification.</p>
<p>It’s a case for continued research that is often evaluated by people who are trained to reward technical merit and methodological thoroughness.</p>
<p>Pitch logic is similar, but the audience is very different. Investors are not deciding whether your work is worthy of continued research. They’re deciding whether it’s worth it to them; their time, their attention, their credibility, their capital—right now, and relative to everything else— they could support instead.</p>
<p>The science never fails in these scenarios. The pitch does.</p>
<p>Founders bring the instincts that earned them success in one arena into a room governed by an entirely different set of rules.</p>
<p>It’s like dropping a pole vaulter into a hockey game—they could be world-class, but they didn’t train to take a hit from a six-foot-five enforcer who’s built like a refrigerator.</p>
<p>In pitch rooms, there’s no deafening air horn and no flashing scoreboard. The loss is quieter because it manifests as polite disengagement. That’s why the feedback often sounds encouraging, even when it’s a clear no:</p>
<ul>
<li>“This is really interesting work.”</li>
<li>“You clearly know the space well.”</li>
<li>“I’m not sure it fits our focus right now, but it’s thoughtful work.”</li>
</ul>
<p>A pitch is not a poster, paper, or grant application.</p>
<p>So, what is it?</p>

<h1>A Pitch’s Purpose</h1>
<p>Time is limited. Attention is divided. Every pitch is assessed relative to alternatives—other teams, other technologies, other possible uses of the same scarce resources. Comparison is constant, whether it’s acknowledged or not.</p>
<p>Now, pause for a moment.</p>
<p>Read the first paragraph again and replace the word “pitch” with the word “decision”. Notice how smoothly the sentences align together despite neither word being a synonym of the other.</p>
<p>This is the context most technical founders overlook: pitches drive investment decisions.</p>
<p>Founders prepare as if they’re entering a museum, only to realize too late that they’ve stepped into an auction house, explaining the item’s history while the room is deciding whether to bid.</p>
<p>They arrive inside an active sorting process, where decisions are made with partial information, finite attention, and a certainty that only a small number of opportunities will move forward.</p>
<p>And the capital being sorted in these rooms isn’t just money. Especially early on, the capital at stake includes time, attention, credibility, and institutional bandwidth.</p>
<p>That can mean a follow-up meeting, an introduction, advocacy behind closed doors, or a willingness to be associated with the work.</p>
<p>Seen through that lens, the governing question of a pitch becomes clearer.</p>
<p>A pitch is not answering:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Is this interesting?”</li>
<li>“Is this impressive?”</li>
<li>“Is this scientifically rigorous?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Many, if not most, technically strong pitches answer those questions well and affirmatively- then stall.</p>

<section id="all-pitches-decide-one-question" class="level1">
<h1>All Pitches Decide One Question:</h1>
<p>This is the question so many technical pitches abstain from answering at the moment it matters most: “should we allocate scarce resources to move this technology and team forward?”</p>
<p>Or even more precisely:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Is this a good use of scarce capital, right now?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-the-room-decides-about-you">What The Room Decides About You</h2>
<p>Ideas evolve. Markets shift. Assumptions fail. Everyone in the room knows that. If academia is the classical physics of the proven, capital is the dark matter of the possible—synthesizing empirical data with the unquantifiable gravity of markets.</p>
<p>That is to say, investors aren’t just assessing your work’s empiricism, they’re also assessing you.</p>
<p>When founders talk about tradeoffs; when they demonstrate their priorities when time runs short; when they can acknowledge uncertainty without losing their footing; whether their answers suggest they’ve navigated difficulties before, or if this is the first real test.</p>
<p>Investors hunt for these signals- <em>any</em> information which gives investors an edge is information they’ll leverage: in what founders emphasize, what they skip, in how they handle questions when the conversation veers off script. It’s all fair game.</p>
<p>This is not because the audience is ignoring the idea. It’s because the idea is solid and, for an investor to conduct their due diligence, they have to test everything else- especially you.</p>

<section id="what-this-means" class="level1">
<h1>What This Means</h1>
<p>Once pitching is understood as a decision environment rather than an exercise in explanation and comprehension, many of the most common gripes start to make more sense.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why more technical explanation rarely helps.</li>
<li>Why structure exists.</li>
<li>Why narrative matters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though these might seem like stylistic preferences or arbitrary hurdles, they are, in fact, features of a decision where saying yes means saying no to someone else. This reframe doesn’t make pitching easier, but it clarifies what pitching is actually doing. Not proving the idea, but answering a vital, specific set of questions about priority, judgment, and readiness to move forward. Right now.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It’s not that the idea is wrong. It’s that it’s not that kind of meeting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>What’s Next</h1>
<p>Thanks for reading. If this resonates—even if it doesn’t—I’d welcome your questions, reactions, or counter-examples.</p>
<p>Future pieces in this series will examine how narrative influences decisions, why pitch structure exists and what breaks when it’s ignored, how different pitch rooms produce different outcomes, and how to interpret both noes and yeses once the meeting is over.</p>
